# 05a-Exercises-pygame-sprites

This excercise serves as an introduction to sprites. It taught me how to create them, how to use images instead of blocks as the sprite, along with changing several variables such as velocity, starting position, and sprite size. I have not yet managed to completed excercise 4.
